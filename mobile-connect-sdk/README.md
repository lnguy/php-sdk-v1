# Mobile Connect PHP SDK

## Motivation

Mobile Connect PHP SDK is designed to help developers quickly bootstrap
their own solutions by seeing how it works and what is required.

## Recommended Setup
- PHP 5.3.*
- Composer 1.0
- PHPUnit 4.8.*
- Apache 2.*

## Installing the PHP server side SDK
To install the SDK you will need to download and install Composer, visit their
website for more details - https://getcomposer.org/

Execute the following to add the packagist link to your composer.json and complete the
installation:

```
php composer.phar install
```

After Composer has successfully installed the dependencies for the Mobile Connect SDK
you will have the SDK source code available for use within your application.

You should be able to run all tests from the root of the SDK application as follows:

```
phpunit src/test/
```

It is recommended you run all tests to verify the dependencies are working and you
target environment will work with the Mobile Connect SDK libraries.
